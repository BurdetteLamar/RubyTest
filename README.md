# RubyTest

This project provides Ruby-based tools for software test automation.

It begins modestly, with just:

- A logger class.
- Some helper classes.
- Tests for those classes.

These tools are intended primarily for use in developing and running regression tests for legacy software.

Much more to come.

You can build the RDoc by cloning and running command

- <code>rake build:rerdoc</code>
  
The RDoc output will be in directory <code>html/</code>, with the index file at:

- [html/index.html](html/index.html)

You can also review all rake tasks by running command

- <code>rake -D</code>

or by visiting the documentation for the [Rakefile](./Rakefile.md).
