# RubyTest

This project provides Ruby-based tools for software test automation.

It begins modestly, with just:
 
- Some helper classes.
- Tests for those classes.

Much more to come.

Hint:  You can build the RDoc by cloning and running command

- <code>rake build:rerdoc</code>
  
The RDoc output will be in directory <code>html/</code>, with the index file at:

- <code>html/index.html</code>

You can also review all rake tasks by running command

- <code>rake -D</code>.
