# RubyTest

This project provides Ruby-based tools for software test automation.

It begins modestly, with just:

- A logger class.
- Examples of its use.
- Some helper classes.
- Tests.

These tools are intended primarily for use in developing and running regression tests for legacy software.

Much more to come.

Links to the other markdown documentation are at:

- [Contents](./Contents.md)

You can build the RDoc by cloning and running command

- <code>rake build:rerdoc</code>
  
The RDoc output will be in directory <code>html/</code>, with the index file at <code>html/index.html</html>.

You can also review all rake tasks by running command

- <code>rake -D</code>

or by visiting the documentation for the [Rakefile](./Rakefile.md).
