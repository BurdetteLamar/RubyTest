# GetLabelsName Test

This is a test for endpoint `GET /labels/:name`, which fetches a label.

## Example Test

[file_source](../tests/get_labels_name_test.rb)

Notes:

- The test creates the label that it will fetch.
- It uses method `Label#delete_if_exist?` before and after, to avoid collisions and to clean up.
- Test uses the data-object method `Label#create` to create the label.
- Class `GetLabelsName` encapsulates the endpoint.
- Its method `verdict_call_and_verify_success`:
  - Accepts the client, a verdict id, and the label to be fetched.
  - Accesses the endpoint.
  - Forms the returned data into a `Label` object.
  - Performs verifications on the label object.
  - Returns the label object.
