# Validating Nested Data Objects

Nested data objects can be validated recursively.

## Example Test

[file_source](../tests/nested_data_valid_test.rb)

Notes:

- Use method `verdict_valid?` to verify that a nested data object's values are valid.
- In section `This is valid`:
  - A new `RateLimit` with valid values is instantiated.
  - Method `RateLimit.verdict_valid? validates and logs each value in the rate limit.
- In section `This is not valid`:
  - A new `RateLimit` with invalid values is instantiated.
  - Method `RateLimit.verdict_valid? validates and logs each value in the rate limit.
  - The invalid value is not in the test itself, but instead comes from the data class.

## Log

[file_source](../logs/test_nested_data_valid.xml)

Notes:

- In section `This is valid`, all verdicts pass.
- When a value has multiple validation verdicts (as all of these do), the verdicts are logged into a separate subsection.
- In section `This is not valid`, three verdicts fail.
