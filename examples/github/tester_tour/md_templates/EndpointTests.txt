# Endpoint Tests

The next few stops will show how to test some GitHub REST API endpoints.

These endpoints will be:

- `GET /labels` - Get all labels.
- `POST /labels` - Create a label.
- `GET /labels/:name` - Get a label by name.
- `PATCH /labels/:name` - Update a label by name.
- `DELETE /labels/:name` - Delete a label by name.
