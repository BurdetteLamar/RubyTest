# Meet the Log and Clients

The test framework sets up for the test by offers objects the test will need:

- An open test log.
- A domain-specific GitHub API client.
- A domain-specific GitHub web UI client.

## Example Test

[file_source](../tests/meet_test.rb)

Notes:

- Create a new test class by deriving from `BaseClassForTest`.
- Choose a test method-name that begins with `test`, which tells the test framework that it can be executed at test-time.
- Call methods inherited from the base class:
  - `prelude`:  yields a `Log` object.
  - `with_api_client`:  yields an `ApiClient` object.
  - `with_ui_client`:  yields a `UiClient` object.

## Log

[file_source](../logs/test_meet.xml)

Notes:

- At the top of the log is a summary of the counts of verdicts, failures (failed verdicts), and errors (unexpected exceptions).
- Element `test_method` gives the test name, timestamp, and duration.
- The section named `Test` contains all logging from the test itself.
- The last section gives the count of errors (unexpected exceptions).  Its verdict expects that count to be 0.
- (Attribute `volatile`, seen in element `verdict`, has to do with the Changes Report, and is of no present interest.)
