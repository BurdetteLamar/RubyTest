# Overview

This tour shows how to use the `RubyTest` framework for testing the GitHub REST API.

This domain-specific GitHub REST API framework is layered onto the underlying RubyTest core framework, and implements:

- A domain-specific API client.
- Nested test sections that product corresponding nested log sections.
- Verifications and validations.
- Exception handling.
- Data objects, derived from robust base classes.
- (More to come).
