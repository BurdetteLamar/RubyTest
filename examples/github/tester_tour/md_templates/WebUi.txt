# Web UI Test

Here's a simple web UI test, one that tests CRUD methods (create, read, update, delete) to operate on `Label` objects.

## Example Test

[file_source](../tests/web_ui_test.rb)

Notes:

- The test first defines:
  - `label_to_create`, a variable to  house data for creating a label.
  - `label_created`, a variable that will house the data for the created label, including new values for `:id` and `:url`.
- In section `Create`:
  - `create!`, a method that first deletes the label if it exists, then creates the label.  (Method `:create`, without the exclamation point, would fail if the label exists.)
  - `:create_return_correct` and `:created_correctly`, symbols that are _verdict identifiers_.  A verdict identifier appears in each verdict method call.
  - `Label.verdict_equal?`,  a method that verifies that the returned label data is correct.
  - `label_returned.verdict_read_and_verify?`, a method that verifies that the label was correctly created in GitHub.
  - `label_created`, a variable that saves the label data for use in the following sections.
- Inn section `Read`:
  - `Label.verdict_equal?`, a method that verifies that the returned label data is correct.
- Inn section `Update`:
  - `Label.verdict_equal?`, a method that verifies that the returned label data is correct.
  - `label_returned.verdict_read_and_verify?`, a method that verifies that the label was correctly updated in GitHub.
- In section `Delete`:
  - `log.verdict_assert_nil?`, a method that verifies that the return value is `nil`.
  - `label_created.verdict_refute_exist?`, a method that verifies that the label was deleted in GitHub.
