# Tester Tour

The Tester Tour covers topics that are of interest to a tester who wants to develop and run tests for a REST API.

This tester is distinguished from an infrastructure developer, who would want to develop infrastructure that supports testing a REST API.

The tour shows how to use the example infrastructure to test a REST API.  The target REST API may be seen at:

- [GitHub REST API](https://developer.github.com/v3/)

Each following tour stop assumes you've seen all its predecessors, so repetition is minimal.
