# CRUD Test

So far, most of the interactions with the API have been for the purpose of explicitly testing an endpoint.

Many times, though, we'll want to _make use of_ an endpoint without _sctually testing it_.

A data class can help with this by providing CRUD methods (create, read, update, delete) that simply perform the desired actions, without testing or logging.

The <code>Label</code> class we've been working with does that.

## Example Test

[file_source](../tests/crud_test.rb)

Notes:

- Here we create, read, update, and delete a <code>Label</code> object, using the CRUD methods (instead of accessing endpoints directly).
- Before creating, we delete the label, if it exists.
