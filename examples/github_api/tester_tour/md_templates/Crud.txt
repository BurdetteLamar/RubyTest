# CRUD

So far, most of the interactions with the API have been via the actual endpoint classes.

Many times, though, we'll want to access the API in a more convenient way, without our having to know details about the endpoints.

(Having to know the endpoint class name and call paramemters would not be burdensome for an API that's reliably consistent.  Testers:  when's the last time you saw an API that's reliably consistent?)

A data class can help with this by providing CRUD methods (Create, Read, Update, Delete) that perform the desired actions.

The <code>Label</code> class we've been working with does just that.

## Example Test

[file_source](../tests/crud_test.rb)

Notes:

- Here we create, read, update, and delete a <code>Label</code> object, using the CRUD methods (instead of accessing endpoints directly).
- The conditional passages show how we would do these both without and with the CRUD methods.
- Before creating, we delete the label, if it exists.
