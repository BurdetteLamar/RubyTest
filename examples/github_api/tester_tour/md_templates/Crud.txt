# CRUD

Methods:

- `obj#create`
- `obj#read`
- `obj#update`
- `obj#delete`
s
## Example Test

[file_source](../tests/crud_test.rb)

Notes:

- Here we create, read, update, and delete a <code>Label</code> object, using the CRUD methods (instead of accessing endpoints directly).
- The conditional passages show how we would do these both without and with the CRUD methods.
- Before creating, we delete the label, if it exists.
