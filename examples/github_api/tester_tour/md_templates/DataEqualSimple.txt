# Verifying a Simple Data Object

## Example Test

[file_source](../tests/data_equal_simple_test.rb)

Notes:

- The test gets a known `IssueLabel`, then clones it.
- We know that `IssueLabel` is flat, but it's good practice to use `deep_clone`, not `clone` just to be sure.
- In the first section:
  - Method `IssueLabel.equal?` tests equality, but does no logging.
  - The `fail unless` proves that it worked.
  - Method `IssueLabel.verdict_equal?` verifies and logs each value in the issue labels.
- In the second section:
  - One value in the issue label is modified.
  - Method `IssueLabel.equal?` tests equality, but does no logging.
  - The `fail if ` proves that it worked.
  - Method `IssueLabel.verdict_equal?` verifies and logs each value in the issue labels.

## Log

[file_source](../logs/test_data_equal_simple.xml)

Notes:

- Each actual value is verified in a separate verdict.
- In section `These are equal`, all verdicts pass.
- In section `These are not equal`, one verdict fails.
