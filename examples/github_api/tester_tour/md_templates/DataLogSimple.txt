# Logging a Simple Data Object

## Example Test

[file_source](../tests/data_log_simple_test.rb)

Notes:

- The GitHub API has numerous resources, including the issue-label resource.
- Class `IssueLabel` derives from base classes that provide it with the ability to log itself, as seen here in the call to method `issue_label.log`.

## Log

[file_source](../logs/test_data_log_simple.xml)

Notes:

- Element `GithubClient` records an interaction with the GitHub API, showing the HTTP method and url.
- Its subelement `execution` shows the timestamp and duration for the interaction.
- The section named `Fetched IssueLabel` shows the values in the fetched issue label.
