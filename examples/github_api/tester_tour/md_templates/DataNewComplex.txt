# Creating a Complex Data Object

This page shows how to create and log an instance of a complex data object.

## Example Test

[file_source](../tests/data_new_complex_test.rb)

Notes:

- The nested hashes are formed into nested data objects.
- Note that the instantiated objects exists only here in the test, and not in the Github API itself.

## Log

[file_source](../logs/test_data_new_complex.xml)

Notes:

- The structure of the logged nested objects:
  - `RateLimit`
    - `RateLimit::Resources`
      - `RateLimit::Core`
      - `RateLimit::Search`
      - `RateLimit::Graphql`
    - `RateLimit::Rate`
