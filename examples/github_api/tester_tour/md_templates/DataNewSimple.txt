# Creating a Simple Data Object

This page introduces simple data classes, and shows how to create instances of them.

## Example Test

[file_source](../tests/data_new_simple_test.rb)

Notes:

- These values are passed to method `IssueLabel.new` in a hash that gives the names and values.
- Note that the instantiated `IssueLabel` exists only here in the test, and not in the Github API itself.
