# The Data Object

A key concept in this framework is the _data object_.

In these examples, a data object corresponds to a GitHub API _resource_.

The main data objects seen here will be:

- `Label`
- `RateLimit`

A data object has _fields_, such as:

- `:name`
- `:id`

Each data class derives from base classes that provide for:

- Initialization.
- Self-logging.
- Verdicts:  automatically-logged verifications.
- Automatically-logged self-validation.
- Determining and verifying resource existence.
