# DeleteLabelsName Test

This is a test for endpoint `DELETE /labels/:name`, which deletes a label.

## Example Test

[file_source](../tests/delete_labels_name_test.rb)

Notes:

- The test creates the label that it will delete.
- It uses method `Label.delete_if_exist?` before and after, to avoid collisions and to clean up.
- Test uses the data-object method `Label.create` to create the label.
- Class `DeleteLabelsName` encapsulates the endpoint.
- Its method `verdict_call_and_verify_success`:
  - Accepts the client, the log, a verdict id, and the label to be deleted.
  - Accesses the endpoint.
  - Verifies that the response is empty.
  - Verifies that the label no longer exists.

## Log

[file_source](../logs/test_delete_labels_name.xml)

Notes:

- Section `GethubClient` shows the endpoint access.
- In section `Evaluation`:
  - Section `Response empty` verifies that the response was empty.
  - Section `Label deleted` verifies that the label no longer exists.
