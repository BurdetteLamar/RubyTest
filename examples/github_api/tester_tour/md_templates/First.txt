# First Test

The test framework sets up for the test by delivering objects the test will need:

- A domain-specific GitHub API client.
- An open test log.

## Example Test

[file_source](../tests/first_test.rb)

Notes:

- Create a new test class by deriving from `BaseClassForTest`.
- Choose a test method-name that begins with `test`, which tells the test framework that it can be executed at test-time.
- Call method `prelude`, inherited from the base class.
- Use the yielded values for your test.
  - A domain-specific GitHub API client.
  - An open test log.  When the test exits the `prelude` block, the log builds its summaries, closes itself, and writes itself as XML.

## Log

[file_source](../logs/test_first.xml)

Notes:

- At the top of the log is a summary of the counts of verdicts, failures (failed verdicts), and errors (unexpected exceptions).
- Element `test_method` gives the test name, timestamp, and duration.
- The section named `With GitHubClient` contains all logging from the test itself.
- The last section gives the count of errors (unexpected exceptions).  Its verdict expects that count to be 0.
- (Attribute `volatile`, seen in element `verdict`, has to do with the Changes Report, and is of no present interest.)
