# Verifying a Data Object

A data class has methods for:

- Testing for object equality (without logging).
- Verifying object equality (with logging).

## Example Test

[file_source](../tests/flat_data_equal_test.rb)

Notes:

- Use method `equal?` to test data object equality, without logging.
- Use method `verdict_equal?` to test object equality, including logging.
- The test gets a known `IssueLabel`, then clones it.
- We know that `IssueLabel` is flat, but it's good practice to use `deep_clone`, not `clone` just to be sure.
- In section `These are equal`:
  - Method `IssueLabel.equal?` tests equality, but does no logging.
  - The `fail unless` proves that it worked.
  - Method `IssueLabel.verdict_equal?` verifies and logs each value in the issue labels.
- In section `These are not equal`:
  - One value in the issue label is modified.
  - Method `IssueLabel.equal?` tests equality, but does no logging.
  - The `fail if ` proves that it worked.
  - Method `IssueLabel.verdict_equal?` verifies and logs each value in the issue labels.

## Log

[file_source](../logs/test_flat_data_equal.xml)

Notes:

- Each actual value is verified in a separate verdict.
- In section `These are equal`, all verdicts pass.
- In section `These are not equal`, one verdict fails.
