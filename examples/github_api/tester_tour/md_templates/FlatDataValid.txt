# Validating a Data Object

A data object can validate itself.

The term _valid_, as used here, is about whether a value is of the correct _form_.  This is as distinguished from the earlier term _equal_, which is about whether the value is _correct_.

Example of usefulness:  creating a new label returns an `Label` object with a new `:id` value.  The _value_ of the `id` is unpredictable, but it is still useful to verify that it is a positive integer, as required.

## Example Test

[file_source](../tests/flat_data_valid_test.rb)

Notes:

- Use method `verdict_valid?` to verify that a data object's data are valid.
- In section `This is valid`:
  - A new `IssueLabel` with valid values is instantiated.
  - Method `IssueLabel.verdict_valid? validates and logs each value in the issue label.
- In section `This is not valid`:
  - A new `IssueLabel` with invalid values is instantiated.
  - Method `IssueLabel.verdict_valid? validates and logs each value in the issue label.
  - The invalid value is not in the test itself, but instead comes from the data class.

## Log

[file_source](../logs/test_flat_data_valid.xml)

Notes:

- In section `This is valid`, all verdicts pass.
- When a value has multiple validation verdicts (as all of these do), the verdicts are logged into a separate subsection.
- In section `This is not valid`, three verdicts fail.
