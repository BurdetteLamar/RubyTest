# Logging Nested Data Objects

Nested data objects can log themselves recursively.

Up to now, the data objects seen have been instances of class `Label`.

These objects are 'flat' in the sense that the values they store are all scalars:

- Integers.
- Strings.
- Booleans.

Now we begin to look at the handling of objects in class `RateLimit`, some of whose values are _not_ scalars, but are actually _instances of other data objects_.  In other words, they're nested data objects.

## Example Test

[file_source](../tests/nested_data_log_test.rb)

Notes:

- Log nested data objects by calling the `log` method.

## Log

[file_source](../logs/test_nested_data_log.xml)

Notes:

- The section named `Fetched rate limit` logs the values in the fetched rate limit.
- The nested objects recursively log themselves into nested log sections.
- The structure of the logged nested objects:
  - `RateLimit`
    - `RateLimit::Resources`
      - `RateLimit::Core`
      - `RateLimit::Search`
      - `RateLimit::Graphql`
    - `RateLimit::Rate`
