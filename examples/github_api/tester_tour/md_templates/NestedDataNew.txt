# Creating Nested Data Objects

## Example Test

[file_source](../tests/nested_data_new_test.rb)

Notes:

- Create a new nested data object by calling method `new` on the data class.
- The nested hashes are formed into nested data objects.
- Note that the instantiated objects exists only here in the test, and not in the Github API itself.
