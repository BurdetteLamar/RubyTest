# Creating Nested Data Objects, Part 2

In the previous stop, we saw how to create nested data objects using nested hashes.  That is, none of the nested objects existed prior to the single call to `new`.

Here we see how to create nested data objects using already-existing data objects.

## Example Test

[file_source](../tests/nested_data_new_2_test.rb)

Notes:

- Create data objects individually by calling their `new` method.
- Instead of passing hashes as arguments, pass already-existing data objects.
- Note that the instantiated objects exists only here in the test, and not in the Github API itself.
