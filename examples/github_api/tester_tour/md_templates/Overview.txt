# Overview

The example tests here show how to test the GitHub REST API using the example test framework.

This GitHub REST API framework is layered onto the underlying RubyTest core framework, and implements:

- A domain-specific API client.
- Nested test sections that product corresponding nested log sections.
- Verifications and validations.
- Exception handling.
- Data objects, derived from robust base classes.
- (More to come).
