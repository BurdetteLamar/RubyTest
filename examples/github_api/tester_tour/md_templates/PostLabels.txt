# PostLabels Test

This is a test for endpoint `POST /labels`, which creates a label.

## Example Test

[file_source](../tests/post_labels_test.rb)

Notes:

- The test calls method `Label.delete_if_exist?` before the creation, to avoid collision with an existing label.
- Class `PostLabels` encapsulates endpoint `POST /labels`.
- Its method `PostLabels.verdict_call_and_verify_success`:
  - Accepts the client, a verdict id, and the label to be created.
  - Accesses the endpoint.
  - Forms the returned data into a `Label` object.
  - Performs verifications on the label object.
  - Returns the label object.
- The test calls method `Label.delete_if_exist?` after the creation, to clean up.

## Log

[file_source](../logs/test_post_labels.xml)

Notes:

- Section `GithubClient` shows the endpoint access, including the parameters.
- In section `Evaluation`:
  - Section `Returned label correct` verifies the created label: `:name` and `:color`.
  - Section `Returned label valid` validates the created label: all fields.
  - Section `Label exists` fetches the new label and verifies all its fields.
