# Verdicts

## Example Test

[file_source](../tests/verdicts_test.rb)

Notes:

- Use `verdict` methods for verifications.
- A call to a verdict method will have:
  - A verdict identifier, which must be unique within the test.
  - Other parameters, as appropriate to the particular method.
  - A message string.
- An `assert` verdict expects something to be truthy (not `false` or `nil`).
- A `refute` verdict expects something to be `false` or `nil`.
- There are many other verdict methods, some of which will be described later in this tour.
- A verdict method returns a boolean value, and therefore follows the Ruby convention of ending the method name with `?`.


## Log

[file_source](../logs/test_verdicts.xml)

Notes:

- Every verdict is fully logged.
- A failed verdict logs its backtrace.
