# First Test

Here's a simple first test, one that tests CRUD methods (create, read, update, delete) to operate on `Label` objects.

## Example Test

[file_source](../tests/first_test.rb)

Notes:

- The test first defines variables:
  - `label_to_create`, which gets data for creating a label via method `Label.provisioned`.
  - `label_created`, which will have the data for the created label, including new values for `:id` and `:url`.
- In section `Create`:
  - Instead of method `create`, we use method `create!`, which first deletes the label if it exists.
  - Symbols `:create_return_correct` and `:created_correctly` are _verdict identifiers_.  A verdict identifier appears in each verdict method call.
  - Method `Label.verdict_equal?` verifies that the returned label data is correct.
  - Method `label_returned.verdict_read_and_verify?` verifies that the label was correctly created in GitHub.
  - Variable `label_created` saves the label data for use in the following sections.
- Inn section `Read`:
  - Method `Label.verdict_equal?` verifies that the returned label data is correct.
- Inn section `Update`:
  - Method `Label.verdict_equal?` verifies that the returned label data is correct.
  - Method `label_returned.verdict_read_and_verify?` verifies that the label was correctly updated in GitHub.
- In section `Delete`:
  - Method `log.verdict_assert_nil?` verifies that the return value is `nil`.
  - Method `label_created.verdict_refute_exist?` verifies that the label was deleted in GitHub.
