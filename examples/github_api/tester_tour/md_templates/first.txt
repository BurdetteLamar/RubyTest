# First Test

Here's a simple first test, one that tests CRUD methods (create, read, update, delete) to operate on `Label` objects.

## Example Test

[file_source](../tests/first_test.rb)

Notes:

- The test first defines variables:
  - `label_to_create`, which has data for creating a label.
  - `label_created`, which will have the data for the created label, including new values for `:id` and `:url`.
- In section `Create`:
  - Instead of method `create`, we use method `create!`, which first deletes the label if it exists.
  - Symbols `:label_created` and `:label_exists` are _verdict identifiers_.  A verdict identifier appears in each verict method call.
  - Method `Label.verdict_equal?` verifies that the returned label data is correct.
  - Method `label_created.verdict_assert_exist?` verifies that the label now actually exists in Github.
- In section `Delete`:
  - Method `label_created.verdict_refute_exist?` verifies that the label no longer exists in Github.
