# Complex Data Object Equality

## Test Source Code

[file_source](../tests/data_equal_complex_test.rb)

Notes:

- The test gets a known User, then clones it.
- We know that User is complex, so in this it's necessary to use <code>deep_clone</code>, not <code>clone</code>.
- In the first section:
  - Method <code>User.equal?</code> returns <code>true</code>, but does no logging.
  - The <code>fail unless</code> proves that it worked.
  - Method <code>User.verdict_equal?</code> verifies and logs each value in the users.
- In the second section:
  - One value in the user is modified.  The changed value is in a nested object.
  - Method <code>User.equal?</code> returns <code>false</code>, but does no logging.
  - The <code>fail if </code> proves that it worked.
  - Method <code>User.verdict_equal?</code> verifies and logs each value in the users.

##  Test Log

[file_source](../logs/test_data_equal_complex.xml)

- In the first section, all verdicts pass.
- In the second section, one verdict fails.
