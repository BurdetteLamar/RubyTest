# Simple Data Object Equality

## Test Source Code

[file_source](../tests/data_equal_simple_test.rb)

Notes:

- The test gets a known Album, then clones it.
- We know that Album is flat, but it's good practice to use <code>deep_clone</code>, not <code>clone</code> just to be sure.
- In the first section:
  - Method <code>Album.equal?</code> returns <code>true</code>, but does no logging.
  - The <code>fail unless</code> proves that it worked.
  - Method <code>Album.verdict_equal?</code> verifies and logs each value in the albums.
- In the second section:
  - One value in the album is modified.
  - Method <code>Album.equal?</code> returns <code>false</code>, but does no logging.
  - The <code>fail if </code> proves that it worked.
  - Method <code>Album.verdict_equal?</code> verifies and logs each value in the albums.

##  Test Log
