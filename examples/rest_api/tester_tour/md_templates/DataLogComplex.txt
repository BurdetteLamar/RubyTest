# Logging a Complex Data Object

This page introduces complex data classes, and shows how to log instances of them.

## Example Test

[file_source](../tests/data_log_complex_test.rb)

Notes:

- Unlike an album, which has only scalar values, a user has a more complex structure.
- Some of its values, such as those for `:name` and `:username`, are simple scalars.
- Other values, such as those for `:address` and `:company`, are more complex.
- When the `User` instance is created, the values for `:address` are formed into an instance of `User::Address`.
- Similarly, the values for `:company` are formed into an instance of `User::Company`.
- There is a further nesting in the values for `:address`:  it contains multi-valued data for `:geo`.  These values are formed into an instance of `User::Address::Geo`.
- Class `User` derives from base classes that provide it with the ability to log itself, as seen here in the call to method `user.log`.
