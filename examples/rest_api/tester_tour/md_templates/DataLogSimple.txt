# Logging a Simple Data Object

This page introduces simple data classes, and shows how to log instances of them.

## Example Test

[file_source](../tests/data_log_simple_test.rb)

Notes:

- The JSONPlaceholder REST API has several resources, including the Album resource.  That resource is represented in this test framework by class `Album`.
- Class `Album` derives from base classes that provide it with the ability to log itself, as seen here in the call to method `album.log`.
