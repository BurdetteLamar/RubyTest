# Logging a Simple Data Object

This page introduces simple data classes, and shows how to log instances of them.

## Example Test

[file_source](../tests/data_log_simple_test.rb)

Notes:

- The JSONPlaceholder REST API has several resources, including the Album resource.  That resource is represented in this test framework by class <code>Album</code>.
- Because this test uses albums, it requires the album class.
- Class <code>Album</code> derives from base classes that provide it with the ability to log itself, as seen here in the call to method <code>album.log</code>.
- This is true of all data objects in the framework.
