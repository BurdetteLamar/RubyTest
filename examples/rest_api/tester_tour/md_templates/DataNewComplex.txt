# Creating a Complex Data Object

This page introduces complex data classes, and shows how to create instances of them.

## Example Test

[file_source](../tests/data_new_complex_test.rb)

Notes:

- When the <code>User</code> instance is created, the values for <code>:address</code> are formed into an instance of <code>User::Address</code>.
- Similarly, the values for <code>:company</code> are formed into an instance of <code>User::Company</code>.
- There is a further nesting in the values for <code>:address</code>:  it contains multi-valued data for <code>:geo</code>.  These values are formed into an instance of <code>User::Address::Geo</code>.
