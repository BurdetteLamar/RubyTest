# Creating a Complex Data Object

This page introduces complex data classes, and shows how to create instances of them.

## Example Test

[file_source](../tests/data_new_complex_test.rb)

Notes:

- When the `User` instance is created, the values for `:address` are formed into an instance of `User::Address`.
- Similarly, the values for `:company` are formed into an instance of `User::Company`.
- There is a further nesting in the values for `:address`:  it contains multi-valued data for `:geo`.  These values are formed into an instance of `User::Address::Geo`.
