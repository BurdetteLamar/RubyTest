# Creating a Simple Data Object

This page introduces simple data classes, and shows how to create instances of them.

## Example Test

[file_source](../tests/data_new_simple_test.rb)

Notes:

- These values are passed to method `Album.new` in a hash that gives the names and values.
- Note that the created album exists only here in the test, and not in the REST API itself.  If it were later created in the API, it would be assigned a non-nil `:id` value.
