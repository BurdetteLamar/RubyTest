# Create Data Objects

This page introduces the data classes, and shows how to create instances of them.

## Test Source Code

[file_source](../tests/data_new_simple_test.rb)

Notes:

- The JSONPlaceholder REST API has several resources, including the Album resource.  That resource is represented in this test framework by class <code>Album</code>.
- The Album resource and its corresponding class are flat, each consisting of only three scalar values, seen here in the call to <code>Album.new</code>.
- These values are passed to method <code>Album.new</code> in a hash that gives the names and values.
- Note that the created album exists only here in the test, and not in the REST API itself.  If it were created in the API, it would be assigned a non-nil <code>:id</code> value.
- Class <code>Album</code> derives from base classes that provide it with the ability to log itself, as seen here in the call to method <code>album.log</code.
- This is true of all data objects in the framework.
