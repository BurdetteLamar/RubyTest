# Validating a Simple Data Object

## Example Test

[file_source](../tests/data_valid_simple_test.rb)

Notes:

- In the first section:
  - A new album with valid values is instantiated.
  - The valid values are not in the test itself, but instead come from the data class.
  - Method `Album.verdict_valid? validates and logs each value in the album.
- In the second section:
  - A new album with invalid values is instantiated.
  - The invalid values are not in the test itself, but instead come from the data class.
  - Method `Album.verdict_valid? validates and logs each value in the album.

## Log

[file_source](../logs/test_data_valid_simple.xml)

Notes:

- In the first section, all verdicts pass.
- When a value has multiple validation verdicts (as all of these do), the verdicts are logged into a separate subsection.
- In the second section, three verdicts fail.
