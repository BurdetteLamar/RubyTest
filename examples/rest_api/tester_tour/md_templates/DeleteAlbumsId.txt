# Test for DELETE Albums/_id_

This page shows how to test DELETE Albums/_id_.

## Test Source Code

[file_source](../tests/delete_albums_id_test.rb)

Notes:

- Method <code>DeleteAlbumsId.verdict_call_and_verify_success</code>:
  1.  Accesses endpoint DELETE albums/_id_, using field <code>:id</code> from the given album <code>album_to_delete</code>.
  2.  Verifies that the return had no payload.
  3.  Verifies that the album no longer exists.

##  Test Log

[file_source](../logs/test_delete_albums_id.xml)

Notes:

- The verdict that confirms the deletion fails, because the JSONPlaceholder REST API does not really delete the album.  That is intentional, and is documented at the website.
