# Test for GET Albums

This page shows how to test GET Albums.

## Example Test

[file_source](../tests/get_albums_test.rb)

Notes:

- This test uses an endpoint, and therefore requires the corresponding class.
- Method `GetAlbums.verdict_call_and_verify_success`:
  1.  Accesses endpoint GET albums.
  2.  Forms the response payload into new `Album` objects.
  3.  Logs the count of returned albums.
  4.  Logs the content of the first album.
  5.  Verifies that each the value in the first album is valid (i.e., has the expected form).

## Log

[file_source](../logs/test_get_albums.xml)

Notes:

- Each `section` element whose `name` is `Rest client` records an interaction with the REST API, including any passed parameters.
- The `section` whose `name` is `Evaluation` contains verdicts about the returned data.
