Notes:

- Method `Album.get_first` is a convenience method that fetches the first album as an `Album` object.
- Method `GetAlbumsId.verdict_call_and_verify_success`:
  1.  Accesses endpoint GET albums/_id_, using field `:id` from the given album `album_to_get`.
  2.  Forms the response payload into a new `Album` object, `album_fetched`.
  3.  Verifies that the values in `album_to_get` are equal to those in `album_fetched`.
