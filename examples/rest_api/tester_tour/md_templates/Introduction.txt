# Introduction

This page begins the Tester Tour of the example REST API testing.

The tour covers only topics of interest to a tester who wants to develop and/or run tests for a REST API.

This tester is distinguished from an infrastructure developer, who would want to develop infrastructure that supports testing a REST API.

Each following page assumes you've seen all its predecessors, and so there's little repetition.
