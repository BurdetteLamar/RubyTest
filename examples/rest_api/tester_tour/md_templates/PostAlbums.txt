# Test for POST Albums

This page shows how to test POST Albums.

## Example Test

[file_source](../tests/post_albums_test.rb)

Notes:

- The test creates a new Album object `album_to_post`.
- Method `PostAlbums.verdict_call_and_verify_success`:
  1.  Accesses endpoint POST albums, using parameter values from `album_to_post`.
  2.  Forms the returned payload into a new Album object, `album_posted`.
  3.  Verifies that `album_posted` matches `album_to_post`.
  4.  Fetches the album as `album_fetched`, using the id from `album_posted`.
  5.  Verifies that `album_fetched` matches `album_posted`.

## Log

[file_source](../logs/test_post_albums.xml)

Notes:

- The fetched album does not match the posted album, because JSONPlaceholder does not really create the album.  That is intentional, and is documented at the website.
