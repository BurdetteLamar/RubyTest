# PutAlbumsId

This page shows how to test endpoint PUT albums/_id_.

## Test Source Code

[file_source](../tests/put_albums_id_test.rb)

Notes:

- Method <code>Album.get_first</code> is a convenience method that fetches the first album as an <code>Album</object>.  It is modified and becomes <album_to_put>.
- Method <code>PutAlbumsId.verdict_call_and_verify_success</code>:
  1.  Accesses endpoint PUT albums/_id_, using field <code>:id</code> from <code>album_to_put</code>.
  2.  Forms the response payload into a new Album object, <code>album_put</code>.
  3.  Verifies that the values in <code>album_put</code> are equal to those in <code>album_to_put</code>.
  4.  Fetches the updated album <code>album_fetched</code>, using parameters from <code>album_put</code>.
  4.  Verifies that the values in <code>album_put</code> are equal to those in <code>album_fetched</code>.

##  Test Log

[file_source](../logs/test_put_albums_id.xml)

- The fetched album does not match the put album, because JSONPlaceholder does not really update the album.  That is intentional, and is documented at the website.
