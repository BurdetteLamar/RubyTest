# Test for PUT Albums/_id_

This page shows how to test PUT Albums/_id_.

## Example Test

[file_source](../tests/put_albums_id_test.rb)

Notes:

- Method `Album.get_first` is a convenience method that fetches the first album as an `Album` object.  It is modified and becomes <album_to_put>.
- Method `PutAlbumsId.verdict_call_and_verify_success`:
  1.  Accesses endpoint PUT albums/_id_, using field `:id` from `album_to_put`.
  2.  Forms the response payload into a new Album object, `album_put`.
  3.  Verifies that the values in `album_put` are equal to those in `album_to_put`.
  4.  Fetches the updated album `album_fetched`, using parameters from `album_put`.
  4.  Verifies that the values in `album_put` are equal to those in `album_fetched`.

## Log

[file_source](../logs/test_put_albums_id.xml)

- The fetched album does not match the put album, because JSONPlaceholder does not really update the album.  That is intentional, and is documented at the website.
