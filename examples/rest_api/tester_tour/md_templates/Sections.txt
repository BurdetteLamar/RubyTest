# Sections and Nesting

This page shows test sections, including nesting, timestamps, and durations.

## Example Test

[file_source](../tests/sections_test.rb)

Notes:

- Use nested sections to organize test code.
- This test does not use the client, and so uses the variable name <code>_</code> instead of variable name <code>client</code>.

## Log

[file_source](../logs/test_sections.xml)

Notes:

- The sections in the test are propagated to the log, so that the log is organized the same way as the test.
