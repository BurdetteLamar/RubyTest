# Sections and Nesting

This page introduces sections, including nesting, timestamps, and durations.

## Test Source Code

[file_source](../tests/sections_test.rb)

Notes:

- Use nested sections to structure test steps.
- (The variables yielded by method <code>prelude</code> are a client and a log.  This test does not use the client, and so uses the variable name <code>_</code> instead of variable <code>client</code>.  This prevents the RubyMine IDE from flagging it as an unused variable during code inspection.)

##  Test Log

[file_source](../logs/test_sections.xml)

Notes:

- The sections in the test are propagated to the log, giving it the same structure.
