# Sections and Nesting

This page introduces sections, including nesting, timestamps, and durations.

## Test Source Code

[file_source](../tests/sections_test.rb)

Notes:

- Use nested sections to organize test code.
- This test does not use the client, and so uses the variable name <code>_</code> instead of variable name <code>client</code>.  This prevents the RubyMine IDE from flagging it as an unused variable during code inspection.)

##  Test Log

[file_source](../logs/test_sections.xml)

Notes:

- The sections in the test are propagated to the log, so that both test and log have the same structure.
