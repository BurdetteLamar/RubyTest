# Simple Test

This page shows a test class, along with its REST API client and test log.

## Example Test

[file_source](../tests/test_test.rb)

Notes:

- The test class derives from the base test class.
- The test method-name begins with `test`, which tells the test framework that it can be executed at test-time.
- Method `prelude`, inherited from the base class, yields:
  - A domain-specific REST API client.
  - An open test log.

## Log

[file_source](../logs/test_test.xml)

Notes:

- At the top of the log is a summary:  counts of verdicts, failures (failed verdicts), and errors (unexpected exceptions).
- The logging for the test steps and verdicts is in element `test_method`, which also gives the test name, timestamp, and duration.
- The last section gives the count of errors (unexpected exceptions).  Its verdict expects that count to be 0.
- (Attribute `volatile`, seen in element `verdict`, has to do with the Changes Report, and is of no present interest.)
