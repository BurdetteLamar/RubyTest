# The Simplest Test

This page introduces the test class, along with the REST API client and the test log.

## Test Source Code

[file_source](../tests/test_test.rb)

Notes:

- Test class <code>TestTest</code> derives from class<code>BaseClassForTest</code>.
- Method name <code>test_test</code> begins with <code>test</code>, which tells the test framework that it is a test method and should be executed at test-time.
- Inherited method <code>prelude</code> yields:
  - The domain-specific client to be used for testing the REST API.
  - The already-open log to be used for documenting the test execution.

##  Test Log

[file_source](../logs/test_test.xml)

Notes:

- Element <code>summary</code>:  counts of verdicts, failures (failed verdicts), and errors (unexpected exceptions).
- Element <code>test_method</code>:  logging for test steps and verdicts.  (This test did nothing, so there's not much here.)
- The last section gives the count of errors (unexpected exceptions).  Its verdict expects the count to be 0.
- Attribute <code>volatile</code>, seen in each <code>verdict</code> element, has to do with the Changes Report, and is of no present.
