# Verdicts

## Test Source Code

This page introduces verdicts.

Each verdict method returns a boolean value, and therefore follows the ruby convention of ending the method name with *?*.

There are many verdict methods.  Some are covered later in these pages.

[file_source](../tests/verdicts_test.rb)

Notes:

- Each verdict has:
  - A verdict identifier, which must be unique within the test.
  - A message string.
- Use an assert verdict to express a positive expectation.
- Use a refute verdict to express a negative expectation.


##  Test Log

[file_source](../logs/test_verdicts.xml)

Notes:

- A failed verdict logs an exception, including the message and backtrace.
