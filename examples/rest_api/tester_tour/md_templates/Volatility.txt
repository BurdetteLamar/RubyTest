# Volatile Return Values

This page introduces verdict volatility.

The Changes Report (elsewhere in this project) identifies changes found in comparing the results of the current and previous test runs.

If a verdict's actual value is different in the two runs, the change would be reported.

There are cases, though, when this would be inappropriate.

Suppose a request creates an object (say, a new user) whose identifier is a new GUID.  Then the identifier will be different in every test run, and by default the Changes Report would note the change, even though the change is actually expected.

Marking a verdict as <code>volatile</code> handles this case.  For a volatile verdict, the Changes Report will ignore the differing values, which is what's wanted.

## Test Source Code

[file_source](../tests/volatility_test.rb)

Notes:

- The first verdict's values are non-volatile, expected to be the same in each test run.  If the value changed from the previous, the Changes Report would mark the verdict as changed.
- The second verdict's values are volatile, changing with each test run.  The Changes Report will not mark the verdict as changed.
