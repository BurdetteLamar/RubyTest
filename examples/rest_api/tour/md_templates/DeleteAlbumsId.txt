# DeleteAlbumsId

## Test Source Code

This page shows how to test endpoint DELETE albums/_id_.

[file_source](../tests/delete_albums_id_test.rb)

Notes:

- Method <code>DeleteAlbumsId.verdict_call_and_verify_success</code>:
  1.  Does <code>DELETE albums/,id</code><i>id</i>, using field <code>:id</code> from the given album <code>album_to_delete</code>.
  2.  Verifies that the return had no payload.
  3.  Verifies that the album no longer exists.

##  Test Log

[file_source](../logs/test_delete_albums_id.xml)

Notes:

- The verdict that confirms the deletion fails, because the JSONPlaceholder REST API does not really delete the album.  That is intentional, and documented at the website.
