# DeleteAlbumsId

## Test Source Code

[file_source](../tests/delete_albums_id_test.rb)

Notes:

- Nested log sections help organize both the test source code and the test log.
- Method <code>Album.get_first</code> is a convenience method that fetches the first album as an <code>Album</object>.
- Variable <code>verdict_id</code> is a verdict identifier that must be unique within the test method.
- Method <code>DeleteAlbumsId.verdict_call_and_verify_success</code> interacts with the REST API and logs information:
  1.  Does <code>DELETE albums/,id</code><i>id</i>, using field <code>:id</code> from the given album <code>album_to_delete</code>.
  2.  Verifies that the return had no payload.
  3.  Verifies that the album no longer exists.

##  Test Log

[file_source](../logs/test_delete_albums_id.xml)

Notes:

- The <code>section</code> elements organize the log.
- Each <code>section</code> element whose <code>name</code> is <code>Rest client</code> records an interaction with the REST API, including any passed parameters.
- Each <code>verdict</code> element contains a verification.
- The <code>section</code> whose <code>name</code> is <code>Evaluation</code> contains verdicts about the returned data.
- The verdict that confirms the deletion fails, because the JSONPlaceholder REST API does not really delete the album.  That is intentional, and documented at the website.
- For the failed verdict, the log reports the exception, including the message and backtrace.
