# Exceptions

This page introduces the handling of unexpected exceptions.

## Test Source Code

[file_source](../tests/exceptions_test.rb)

Notes:

- The first outer section rescues its exception.  Following code in the *section* is not reached.
- The second outer section does not rescue its exception.  Following code in the *test* is not reached.

##  Test Log

[file_source](../logs/test_exceptions.xml)

Notes:

- Each logged exception includes its message and backtrace.
- The second exception, the one the test didn't rescue, is actually rescued by the log itself, and of course logged.
