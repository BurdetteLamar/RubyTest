# VolatilityTest

## Test Source Code

[file_source](../tests/volatility_test.rb)

Notes:

- The Changes Report (elsewhere in this project) evaluates a current test run's logs against those of the previous test run.
- Above:
  - The first verdict's values are non-volatile, expected to be the same in each test run.  If the value changed from the previous, the Changes Report would mark the verdict as changed.
  - The second verdict's values are volatile, changing with each test run.  The Changes Report will not mark the verdict as changed.
