# NothingTest

## Source Code

[file_source](../tests/nothing_test.rb)

### Notes

- The test class derives from class<code>BaseClassForTest</code>.
- The test method <code>test_nothing</code> begins with <code>test</code>, which tells the test framework that it is a test method and should be executed at test-time.
- Inherited method <code>prelude</code> yields:
  - The domain-specific client to be used for testing the REST API.
  - The already-open log to be used for documenting the test execution.

##  Test Log

[file_source](../logs/test_nothing.xml)

### Notes

Elements:

- <code>summary</code>:  counts of verdicts, failures (failed verdicts), and errors (unexpected exceptions).
- <code>test_method</code>:  logging for test steps and verdicts.  (This test did nothing, so there's not much here.)
- <code>verdict</code>:  Expected no errors (unexpected exceptions), got none.
